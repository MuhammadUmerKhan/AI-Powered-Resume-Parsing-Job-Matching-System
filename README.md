![Resume Parser](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGeVOhx27jdqQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1732253495805?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=BNfCukca2GVw7Vhv6QUe2jxW2kxX_-LDH_TLBSCiozE)

In the fast-paced world of recruitment, manually sifting through resumes can be a tedious and time-consuming task. This project aims to automate the process of parsing resumes, extracting key information, and categorizing them efficiently using AI. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, the Resume Parser ensures that recruiters can focus on the most relevant details, optimizing the hiring process. 🧑‍💻🌟

This repository contains the code, model, and tools necessary for building a state-of-the-art resume parser, capable of extracting personal information, skills, education, experience, and other key elements from resumes in various formats. 📂📝

## 🛡️ Problem Statement 
Recruitment teams often struggle with the overwhelming volume of resumes they receive for job openings. Parsing these resumes manually to extract key information like contact details, skills, and work experience is inefficient and prone to errors. This project uses AI techniques to automatically parse resumes, extract relevant data, and present it in an organized manner for recruiters. 🎯

By using this tool, the time spent on screening resumes can be drastically reduced, enabling hiring managers to focus more on high-priority tasks such as candidate interviews and decision-making. 🕛🔍

## 🔧 Methodology 
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:** 📊
   - Collected a dataset consisting of resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
   - Preprocessed the data by converting these resumes into structured text for further analysis.

2. **Text Preprocessing:** 🧺
   - Performed tasks such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
   - Cleaned and standardized the text to ensure accurate extraction.

3. **Resume Categorization:** 📂
   - Categorized resumes based on job titles using semantic similarity scoring (SBERT).
   - Developed a job title classification function for automated categorization of resumes into broad job categories.

4. **Model Deployment:** 🚀
   - The model was deployed as a [Streamlit app](https://ai-powered-resume-parser.streamlit.app/), providing an intuitive interface for resume parsing and job matching.
